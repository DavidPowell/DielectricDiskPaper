# Interference between the modes of an all-dielectric meta-atom

This repository contains all calculations used in the paper "Interference between the modes of an all-dielectric meta-atom",
a preprint of which is currently available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04980).

This calculations are performed using an open source code [OpenModes](http://davidpowell.github.io/OpenModes). The website for
this software package includes several examples, which give an easy introduction to the basic features.

All calculations are performed in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/), which allow mixing of documentation, code,
figures and equations. They can be previewed on github, but better results may be obtained through the
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DavidPowell/DielectricDiskPaper/tree/master/) service.
